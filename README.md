# Forecast Failures of Econometric Models during Economic Shocks

### **Project Objective**
This research evaluates the forecasting limitations of statistically significant econometric models during extreme market volatility, specifically focusing on the **2007-08 Global Financial Crisis** and the **2020 COVID-19 Pandemic**.

### **Technical Stack**
* **Languages:** R (Original Research) & Python (Current Technical Port).
* **Model Architecture:** ARIMAX (ARIMA with Exogenous Regressors).
* **Libraries:** `yfinance`, `statsmodels`, `scipy`, `sklearn`.
* **Data Source:** Daily historical values from Yahoo Finance (1998–2020).

### **Methodology & Rigor**
* **Variable Selection:** Modeled the **S&P 500** index using the DJIA, Nasdaq, Russell 2000, VIX, and 10-year Treasury yields.
* **Statistical Diagnostics:**
    * **Stationarity:** Verified using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests and ACF/PACF plots.
    * **Heteroskedasticity:** Identified via Breusch-Pagan tests and treated using **Log-Log Transformations**.
    * **Autocorrelation:** Evaluated using the Durbin-Watson test.

### **Key Results**
The project utilized **ARIMA(1,1,1)** models to compare forecasting performance against real-world "Black Swan" events:

| Scenario | P-Value (Significance) | MAE (Error Magnitude) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2008 Financial Crisis** | **5.8e-07** | **30.09** | **Systemic Failure** |
| **2020 COVID-19 Pandemic** | **3.9e-07** | **24.47** | **Systemic Failure** |

* **2007-08 Financial Crisis:** Identified a statistically significant failure in mean predictions, confirming that models calibrated on "normal" periods cannot account for systemic feedback loops.
* **COVID-19 Pandemic:** Confirmed forecast failure during the February 2020 market crash, highlighting the "Accuracy Gap" created by extrinsic unpredictability.



### **Strategic Conclusion**
The study concludes that relying solely on econometric models for economic forecasting is risky during periods of shock. Resilient policy frameworks require **diversified forecasting tools**, **scenario analysis**, and **qualitative assessments** to manage the uncertainties associated with global financial systems.
